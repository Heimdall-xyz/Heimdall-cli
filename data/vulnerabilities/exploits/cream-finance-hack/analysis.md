# Cream Finance Flash Loan Attack

**Date:** 2021-10-27
**Amount Lost:** $130 million
**Type:** Flash Loan Price Manipulation

## Description

Cream Finance was exploited through a complex flash loan attack that manipulated asset prices and drained funds from the protocol.

## Root Cause

The attacker used a flash loan to manipulate the price of yUSD on Curve, then used this distorted price to borrow more assets than they should have been able to from Cream Finance.

## Lessons Learned

DeFi protocols should implement circuit breakers, time-weighted average prices, and multiple price oracles to protect against flash loan price manipulation attacks.
