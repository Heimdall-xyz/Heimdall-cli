  "description": "Cream Finance was exploited through a complex flash loan attack that manipulated asset prices and drained funds from the protocol.",
  "root_cause": "The attacker used a flash loan to manipulate the price of yUSD on Curve, then used this distorted price to borrow more assets than they should have been able to from Cream Finance.",
  "lessons": "DeFi protocols should implement circuit breakers, time-weighted average prices, and multiple price oracles to protect against flash loan price manipulation attacks.",
