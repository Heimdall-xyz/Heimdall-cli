# Nomad Bridge Hack

**Date:** 2022-08-01
**Amount Lost:** $190 million
**Type:** Input Validation

## Description

The Nomad bridge was exploited due to a configuration error during a routine upgrade. The team initialized the trusted root to be 0x00, which had the effect of auto-proving every message. This allowed users to forge arbitrary messages and drain funds from the bridge.

## Root Cause

A configuration change made during the implementation of the Replica contract upgrade allowed the zero hash to be treated as a valid root. This meant that any arbitrary message could be proven valid.

## Lessons Learned

Proper validation of protocol parameters is essential, especially during upgrades. Configuration changes should undergo the same rigorous testing as code changes.
