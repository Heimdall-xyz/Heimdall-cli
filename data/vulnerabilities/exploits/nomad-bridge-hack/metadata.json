  "description": "The Nomad bridge was exploited due to a configuration error during a routine upgrade. The team initialized the trusted root to be 0x00, which had the effect of auto-proving every message. This allowed users to forge arbitrary messages and drain funds from the bridge.",
  "root_cause": "A configuration change made during the implementation of the Replica contract upgrade allowed the zero hash to be treated as a valid root. This meant that any arbitrary message could be proven valid.",
  "lessons": "Proper validation of protocol parameters is essential, especially during upgrades. Configuration changes should undergo the same rigorous testing as code changes.",
