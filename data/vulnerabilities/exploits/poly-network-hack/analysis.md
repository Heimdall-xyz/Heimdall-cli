# Poly Network Hack

**Date:** 2021-08-10
**Amount Lost:** $610 million
**Type:** Access Control Vulnerability

## Description

An attacker exploited a vulnerability in the Poly Network's cross-chain protocol that allowed them to modify the keeper role and execute unauthorized transactions.

## Root Cause

The vulnerability was in the EthCrossChainManager contract that allowed the attacker to call functions they shouldn't have been able to access, including the ability to transfer assets to an address of their choosing.

## Lessons Learned

Proper access control mechanisms are essential in smart contracts. Critical functions should implement rigorous permission checks and enforce proper separation of privileges.
