# Ronin Bridge Hack

**Date:** 2022-03-23
**Amount Lost:** $620 million
**Type:** Validator Compromise

## Description

The Ronin bridge was compromised when an attacker gained access to private keys used to validate transactions, allowing them to authorize fraudulent withdrawals.

## Root Cause

The attacker gained control of 5 of the 9 validator nodes, primarily through social engineering. This gave them enough control to authorize withdrawals. The security breach went undetected for six days.

## Lessons Learned

Validator key management is critical in bridge security. Systems should implement proper monitoring for unusual withdrawals and maintain a diversified validator set with robust security practices.
