  "vulnerability_type": "Validator Compromise",
  "description": "The Ronin bridge was compromised when an attacker gained access to private keys used to validate transactions, allowing them to authorize fraudulent withdrawals.",
  "root_cause": "The attacker gained control of 5 of the 9 validator nodes, primarily through social engineering. This gave them enough control to authorize withdrawals. The security breach went undetected for six days.",
  "lessons": "Validator key management is critical in bridge security. Systems should implement proper monitoring for unusual withdrawals and maintain a diversified validator set with robust security practices.",
