# Wormhole Bridge Exploit

**Date:** 2022-02-02
**Amount Lost:** $320 million
**Type:** Signature Verification Bypass

## Description

An attacker exploited a vulnerability in the Wormhole bridge's signature verification system, allowing them to forge valid signatures and mint tokens without actually locking them on the origin chain.

## Root Cause

The signature verification function was modified during an upgrade, but one call path failed to properly validate signatures, allowing the attacker to extract 120k wETH.

## Lessons Learned

Complete verification of signatures is critical in cross-chain bridges. All code paths must be thoroughly tested, especially after upgrades or changes to security-critical functions.
