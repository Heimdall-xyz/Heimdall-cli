  "vulnerability_type": "Signature Verification Bypass",
  "description": "An attacker exploited a vulnerability in the Wormhole bridge's signature verification system, allowing them to forge valid signatures and mint tokens without actually locking them on the origin chain.",
  "root_cause": "The signature verification function was modified during an upgrade, but one call path failed to properly validate signatures, allowing the attacker to extract 120k wETH.",
  "lessons": "Complete verification of signatures is critical in cross-chain bridges. All code paths must be thoroughly tested, especially after upgrades or changes to security-critical functions.",
